        <p>
          Illuman is a fellowship of men transforming men through a power greater than ourselves. Our experience shows us that the pain we do not transform we will transmit, so we seek a life-changing spirituality. We carry on the work started by <a href="https://cac.org/richard-rohr/richard-rohr-ofm/" target="_blank">Fr. Richard Rohr</a> which recovers traditional patterns of male initiation, affirms a masculine path to healing, reveals the true and false self, and honors the path of descent.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do this through the power of ritual, image, story, and council. Our primary concern is inner work that expands the depth and breadth of love in ourselves and that makes a difference in the world. We seek to form future generations of men who will restore these practices — serving to build a world that celebrates the beauty of all beings.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are our five touchstones of spiritual practice:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Centering</strong>: we are men grounded in the here and now</li>
          <li><strong>Gathering</strong>: we are men who listen deeply to each other's stories</li>
          <li><strong>Connecting</strong>: we are men who choose another to walk with - shoulder to shoulder</li>
          <li><strong>Releasing</strong>: we are men who let go of the ways that no longer serve us</li>
          <li><strong>Serving</strong>: we are men who honor the earth and serve the whole human community</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Council is <em>strictly confidential</em>. These are the Four Intentions: 
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Speak from the Heart</strong>: we tell our stories, experiences, and dreams</li>
          <li><strong>Listen from the Heart</strong>: we listen from a deep place within</li>
          <li><strong>Be Spontaneous</strong>: we don't rehearse our share as we listen to others</li>
          <li><strong>Be Lean of Speech</strong>: we share the emotions without explanations or details</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

          The tradition of Council is an ancient spiritual practice. It is <em>not:</em>
        </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>a discussion group</li>
            <li>a place to debate ideas</li>
            <li>a place to get or give answers or advice</li>
            <li>a place to be held accountable by others</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
           Council is a place uncommon to the rest of life where you are invited to put down your many identities and roles you play, reconnect to Life itself, and sink deeper into your true self. Bring your pain, strength, power, weakness, glory, blessing, or whatever else it is that you are to address at this moment in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Council is a place to tackle life head-on, as awake and honest to your reality as you dare. A large part of our practice of Council is telling our own stories. It is also a place to practice a radical form of listening to others and the spirit. We want to be open to the Mystery of the spirit that arises within the wisdom and discernment of the Council.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recognize that we run out of words in the presence of something larger than ourselves. This necessarily widens the circle of men, extending our vision to a wider community to which we also have to listen. When we are touched, moved, and inspired by Council, something new is created in us that anchors these primal teachings in the personal realm of direct experience.
        </p>
